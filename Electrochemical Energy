## Event Description:

We hear “Save Energy, Save Earth” all the time, but how would you STORE ENERGY for better future use? What if we told you there is a way for you to do it on your own? Where YOU could build your own batteries, fuel cells and Supercapacitor? Not your-old-school way but rather learn from real life experts from leading Indian Research Agencies like CSIR-CECRI.

We will take you right from how YOU can design and fabricate energy storage devices on your own as well analyze their performance. Can you survive a life with no batteries or sources of energy? Doubtful! So, Charge up! Catch the ever-emerging wave of necessity for cleaner and greener energy storage!
