Mathematics is a subject that has always been unfairly associated with complexity and monotony. We at Anokha believe that it is time to break such stereotypes and revel in the wonder that it truly is. So, this year we bring to you Math Relay - an interactive problem-solving game.

The game is closely linked to the traditional game of relay while also allowing students to experience the joys of problem-solving.
