# Spaghetti Bridge

This unique and interactive game will challenge your engineering skills as you design and construct a bridge made entirely out of spaghetti noodles.

In this team-based competition, participants will be divided into teams and provided with a set of materials including spaghetti noodles, glue, and other supplies to build their bridges. The objective of the game is to construct a bridge that can support the maximum load without collapsing or breaking. Teams will have to apply their engineering knowledge and principles to create a sturdy and efficient bridge that can withstand the weight.

The event will be a thrilling experience as participants will get to put their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills to the test. Collaborate with your team members to come up with the best design, plan your construction, and execute your ideas to build a spaghetti bridge that can withstand the challenges.

### Instructions to the participants

- In this event, each team consists of four members.
- Familiarize yourself with the properties of spaghetti, such as its strength, flexibility, and weight-bearing capacity. This will help you design a strong and stable bridge.
- Plan your design carefully, considering the minimum span of the bridge that has been provided. Consider factors such as the shape, height, and thickness of the bridge, as well as the placement of supports and the distribution of weight.
- Use the spaghetti provided to construct your bridge, being mindful of the amount of material you use. Remember that the load carrying capacity of the bridge will be measured against its own weight, so keeping the weight down is important.
- Test your bridge for stability and strength before the final testing day. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that it is as strong and stable as possible.
- On the day of the final testing, be prepared to explain your design and construction process to the judges. They may ask questions about your choices and your approach, so be ready to defend your decisions.
- Finally, have fun and enjoy the challenge of building a spaghetti bridge! It's a great opportunity to learn about engineering, teamwork, and problem-solving. Good luck!

### Rules

- The minimum span of the bridge will be given to each team before the competition. If the parameters given are not met by the team, they will be disqualified.
- The bridge must be constructed entirely out of spaghetti and glue provided, no additional materials or resources are allowed.
- Teams must work within the given time frame to build their bridge. Any bridges not completed in the given time frame will be disqualified.
- The bridge will be tested until failure to determine the load carrying capacity to self-weight ratio.
- The team with the highest load carrying capacity to self-weight ratio will be declared the winner.
- Bridges must be safe to test - any bridges that appear unsafe or unstable may be disqualified prior to testing.
- Judges reserve the right to disqualify any team or bridge that does not comply with the rules or is deemed unsafe.
- Participation of members other than team members will lead to disqualification.
