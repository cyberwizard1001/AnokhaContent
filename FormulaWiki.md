### Instructions to Participants

**_Round 1: Endgame_**

- Participants will be given a paragraph from the final article and the chain that leads to it. They must find the name of the article.
- For example, consider this paragraph: The X was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in art, architecture, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology, politics, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. X scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.
  And the path is as follows:

  Elizabeth II → Queen Regent → Late Middle ages → X

- It is up to the participant to find X  (the links lead up to the answer thematically, the answer here is Renaissance).
- Evaluation Pattern
  - Number of Questions: 5
  - Points, if correctly answered: 10
  - Points, if incorrectly answered: 0
  - Points, if left unanswered: 0
  - Time per question per team: 1 minute

**_Round 2: The Missing Link_**

- The participants will be given a path with a missing link. They must complete the path which has been chosen thematically i.e., the path is logically trying to lead to a certain page. For example, consider the path: Renaissance → Michelangelo → X → Vatican → Pope
- Can have more than one correct answer
- Evaluation Pattern
  - Number of Questions: 1
  - Points, if correctly answered: 30
  - Points, if incorrectly answered: -10
  - Points, if left unanswered: 0
  - Time per question per team: 1 minute and 30 seconds

**_Round 3: Wikiracing_**

- The objective of this round is to find the shortest path between two pages.
- 12 questions shall be asked, each being open to answers for only 1 minute and 30 seconds in a rapid-fire format.
- Once a team chooses to answer, said shortest path will be locked in for that team (only one chance) until a shorter path is found by another team.
- The shortest valid path at the end of 1 minute and 30 seconds wins 10 points.

**_Round 4: Quizzer’s Hubris_**

- Each team is given 10 points at the beginning of the round. Each team gets 3 questions. The team can place a bet on 1 to 10 points on the question. If they solve the question correctly, they get a percentage of their points back depending on how close they are to the answer. If they cannot answer or answer incorrectly, they lose the initial bet. If the team runs out of points to bet on, they can place bets with previously earned points.
- The questions shall be the same as the previous round and shorter the path that the participants find (number of clicks) the better their returns.
- Time per question per team: 1 minute 30 seconds
  **_Prelims_**

* The goal of the game is to find a link between two Wikipedia pages. This round will be in the form of an online quiz. Participants will be asked to find a connection within a specified set of clicks. For example, a path between Idli and Queen Elizabeth with 4-5 clicks would be : Idli → Indian Cuisine → Britain → United Kingdom → Charles II → Elizabeth II.

**_Finals_**

- The finals will consist of 6 (nominal) to 10 (in case of large turn up in prelims) teams of 2 participants each. In the finals, participants on the stage will be monitored by volunteers to ensure that they are not using any unfair means. Each of the rounds shall be different.

* Prize Money:
    * First Place: Rs. 5000/-
    * Second Place: Rs. 3000/-
    * Third Place: Rs. 2000/-
