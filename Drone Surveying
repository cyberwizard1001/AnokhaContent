## Benefits and Takeaways:

-   Understanding Land Surveying using drone
    
-   Select and operate  appropriate drone surveying equipment for their projects
    
-   Pre-site visit to create flight plan for collecting remote sensing drone data
    
-   Post processing to generate survey results such as 3D model, orthomosaic, DSM, contours.
    
-   Understand the importance of safety and compliance in drone surveying projects
    
-   To be able to create orthomosaics and 3D models which can help to measure accurate distance as well as surfaces and volumes of physical objects.
