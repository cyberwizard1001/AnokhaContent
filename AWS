## Event Description:

Cloud computing is a paradigm shift in the way that businesses and individuals utilize computing resources. Instead of relying on local hardware and software to store and process data, cloud computing allows users to access a wide range of computing resources over the internet, including storage, computing power, and applications.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud computing platforms, providing a comprehensive suite of services that enable customers to build and deploy applications in the cloud. AWS offers a range of services, including computing, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and more. AWS services are designed to be highly scalable, reliable, and secure, allowing customers to focus on their applications and business needs, rather than managing infrastructure.

  
The workshop aims to equip the participants with the technical and theoretical ability to work efficiently with AWS. The faculty draws from years of experience, well-suited to guide you along each aspect of the curriculum. If you're just getting started with AWS, this workshop is the perfect way to gain hands-on experience and deepen your understanding of how AWS can help you build and scale your applications. So come join us and get ready to take your cloud skills to the next level!
