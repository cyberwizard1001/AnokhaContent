## Event Description:

Delving into what goes behind machines like robots, robotic arms and self-driven cars is what’s spiking curiosity in everyone. More than the amazement of these advancements, we all want to know more about what goes behind them and how they work. So here we are at the Robot Operating System (ROS) workshop by the Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) department at one of India’s largest National Techfest Anokha, in Amrita University, Coimbatore India.

For those outside the large community of ROS, ROS provides libraries and tools for programming robots, including drivers for sensors and actuators, navigation and perception algorithms, and communication protocols.

This workshop is being conducted by Anya Robotics, who are working to create robots that enrich people’s lives, approximating the mobility, dexterity, and agility of humans. With a focus on curiosity and respect for the natural world, they aim to build machines that reduce the danger, repetition, and physical difficulty of work.

## Benefits/Takeaways:

Our ROS workshop would provide an in-depth introduction to the ROS framework and its various tools and libraries. Participants would learn about the ROS ecosystem and how to use ROS to program and control robots. They would also gain hands-on experience with integrating different ROS packages and tools to build robotic systems. The workshop would be a valuable learning opportunity for anyone interested in robotics and ROS.
