# Circuit Hunt

Looking for an electrifying adventure that will out your circuitry skills to the test? Then join us at Circuit Hunt, the ultimate treasure hunt based on a QR code for electrical engineers!

With challenging puzzles of multiple complexities, youâ€™ll need to flex your problem-solving muscles to debug and construct circuits to uncover hidden treasures! Come and experience this thrill, only at Circuit Hunt!

### Instructions to Participants

- This event is a QR code-based treasure hunt, where the treasures are nothing but electrical circuits with varying complexities to solve, debug and construct.

- The QR code leads to different circuits and other hints.

- Each team can solve any number of circuits in the given time of 1 hour and 30 minutes.

1. Each team can have between 3 to 4 members.
2. There will be multiple QR codes available across the whole floor of AB2.
3. Most QR codes will have some set of questions associated with it which can be viewed by scanning them
4. Few QR codes will redirect or show hint for other QR codes act as map for the treasure hunt
5. The questions are classified in four categories: Easy, Medium, Difficult and Golden Questions. The questions have different weightage of points.
6. The questions can be of debugging a circuit, theory based, designing a circuit or can just be a pen and paper based.
7. At the end of the stipulated time, the top 3 teams to acquire the maximum number of points wins the event
8. All the questions will be in and around the concepts of electric circuits, op amps, diodes
