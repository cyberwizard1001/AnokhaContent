# ML Tussle

Initially teams are given puzzles to solve, which later determines the complexity of the datasets they will get later for the ML Contest

With the given dataset, teams are expected to process and predict or classify for the given problem with high accuracy.

### Instructions to Participants

1. Each team can have between 3 to 4 members.
2. Participants must use their own computers and use only Jupyter Notebook to participate in the event.
3. The event consists of 2 rounds
4. The organizers of ML Tussle reserve the right to disqualify any participant who violates the rules and regulations.
5. Puzzle Round: A quiz trivia and puzzle involving machine learning basics a. The quiz trivia will consist of multiple-choice questions about machine learning concepts. b. The puzzle will be a challenge that requires participants to use their machine learning skills to solve a problem.
6. Data Processing Round: A data exploration and model training challenge
7. Participants will be given a dataset and asked to train a model to predict a target variable.
8. The top 3 team with the highest accuracy model and best exploratory data analysis will be the ultimate winner
